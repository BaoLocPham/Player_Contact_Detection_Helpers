In this video you can see the labels for this play, approximately linked with the associated helmets within the video.
Note in this video:

- **Black** helmet boxes indicate that player is not in contact. A unique number (home/visiting combined with jersey number) is shown next to their helmet.
- **Green** helmet box indicates the player is in contact with one or more players.
- **Red** helmet box indicates the player is in contact with the ground (and possibly another player).
- **Blue** lines show the link between players in contact with each other.
